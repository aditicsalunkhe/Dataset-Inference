# Dataset-Inference
This repository contains implementation of Ownership Resolution of Machine Learning Models using Dataset Inference

# Steps for execution
1. Download Python 3.7.2 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/)
2. Create a virtual environment with python 3.7 using the command: /path/to/python3 -m venv /path/to/directory/virtual_env_name
3. Install all the dependencies using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. After all the dependencies are installed, there are different parts of execution:  a) Train the victim model and the adversaary model: We have already trained the victim model for direct use. You can access pretrained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v4VeVT3TjQJ-SJFMzGFNFqA-BHHthhDN?usp=drive_link).
     Download the pretrained models from  Dataset Inference -> Pre-trained Models -> models. Place the folder in the root directory and proceed to the next part.
